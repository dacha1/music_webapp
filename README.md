# MUSIC WEBAPP
Webapp based on django
Music_webapp is a website that is used to promote the artists. This website gives the details information about the artists biography such as brief background, genre, their nationality, locations and about their albums. This app also provide social media information of the artists. I had used different programming language and tools such as Django framework, github for version control, python, postgres for database, pycharm, Html, CSS. As a user I am able to login or register using email id. I can view the home page with the list of artists. As I am the admin I can add, delete, edit, update artist records to an admin page. I can add albums to the website. I can add, remove, update adminor users. I I am also able to view artists social media account links, can see album of each artists. I can also able to visit youtube channel or soundcloud of each artists to listen to them.
